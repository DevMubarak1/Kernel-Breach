# Kernel Breach

Kernel Breach is a terminal-based security simulation where the player acts as a network operator attempting to bypass an advanced firewall system.

## Overview

The simulation takes place entirely within a command-line interface. Users must monitor the flow of incoming data packets—represented as distinct visual entities moving across the terminal—and intercept them before they reach the system core.

## Core Mechanics

* **Packet Interception:** Neutralize incoming data packets by identifying their attributes and entering corresponding terminal inputs.
* **Terminal Interface:** A functional command line allows for the execution of system-level operations to destabilize the firewall.
* **Command Logic:** Advanced gameplay requires the use of specific syntax, such as `overload --firewall`, to progress through security layers.
